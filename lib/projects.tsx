    NextAuth.js and JWTs provide a powerful solution for full-stack authentication in Next.js applications. Users can log in through familiar providers like Google or custom forms, with NextAuth handling the verification process seamlessly. Once a user logs in successfully, a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing encrypted user information is generated. This JWT acts like a digital key, stored securely in a user's browser cookie.  Pages and features requiring login check for the presence of this JWT before granting access. By leveraging NextAuth for token management and JWTs for stateless security, your application benefits from a smooth user experience and robust protection on both the front-end and back-end.
